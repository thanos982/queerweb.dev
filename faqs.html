        <div class="question">
          <a href="#" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapseOne" aria-controls="collapseOne">
                What kind of work can I expect from you and what not?

      </div>
      <div id="collapseOne" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="faqOne" data-parent="#faqs">
        <p>I code for websites and I also help with setting up technical stuff that my clients might be finding daunting.</p>
        <p>I don't do any branding, graphics or content copyright work.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="faqTwo">
        <div class="question">
          <a href="#" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapseTwo" aria-controls="collapseTwo">
            How much do you charge?
          </a>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div id="collapseTwo" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="faqTwo" data-parent="#faqs">
        <p>For for-profit companies I charge &euro;600/&pound;530 per day or &euro;80/&pound;70 per hour.<br/>
          For non-profit projects or individuals whose values I share, my rates vary.<br/>
          I sometimes donate some of my time too. </p>
        <p>For individuals just starting out I can also make payment arrangements in instalments. </p>
        <p>I also love exchanging services instead of payments in cash. If you have something to offer, especially in the wellness area, I'm happy to discuss how we can make this work.</p>
        <p>I'm currently open for work exchange with personal trainers, life coaches, massage therapists, sexological bodyworkers, pilates instructors and tattoo artists. (please note that I'm mostly based in Berlin these days).</p>

      <div id="faqThree">
        <div class="question">
          <a href="#" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapseThree" aria-controls="collapseThree">
            How much does a website cost?
          </a>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div id="collapseThree" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="faqThree" data-parent="#faqs">
        <p>The short answer is, it depends.</p>
        <p>Web development is a complex process, and the more custom a website the more expensive it's going to be. If you <a href="/contact">send me an email</a> about what you need, I can give you a rough estimate.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="faqFour">
        <div class="question">
          <a href="#" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapseFour" aria-controls="collapseFour">
            How long will it take to get things done?
          </a>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div id="collapseFour" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="faqFour" data-parent="#faqs">
        <p>The short answer is, sorry to disappoint but a lot more than you think.</p>
        <p>I will admit that I'm pretty bad at giving estimates but that's the nature of my job too. Something that looks simple might be simple just because there was a lot of work that went on behind the scenes.</p>

      <div id="faqFive">
        <div class="question">

      <div id="collapseFive" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="faqFive" data-parent="#faqs">
        <p>I love coding with Ruby on Rails and it's my preferred language. I'm a full-stack developer, so I do HTML/CSS, Javascript, AWS, APIs and all that lot. In the past I've used PHP, some .NET. and a fair number of different other frameworks and platforms. </p>
        <p>Whenever I can, I also make fun stuff with Processing.</p>

      <div id="faqSix">
        <div class="question">
          <a href="#" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapseSix" aria-controls="collapseSix">
            Can I see examples of your work?

      </div>
      <div id="collapseSix" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="faqSix" data-parent="#faqs">
        <p>I'm afraid you can't see most of my work, as it's password protected. But you can message me and I can send you some screenshots.</p>
