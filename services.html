<h1>What I do</h1>

<p>I’m a website and application coder, for both what happens behind the scenes and what you see and experience on the front. Some of my previous work includes events management and booking systems, application forms and data collection web apps, insights and analytics as well as various custom content management systems. </p>

<p>I can help you if</p>
<ul>
  <li>Wordpress, Squarespace, Wix, Shopify or other popular platforms are not good for what you’re looking for and your needs are more complex.</li>
  <li>you or your team find that you’re doing repetitive, time-consuming tasks that have to do with data.</li>
  <li>you need someone to set up your e-shop, blog or portfolio website.</li>
</ul>
