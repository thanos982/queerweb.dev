<h1>About me</h1>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-lg-10">
    <p>I've been working as a web developer for 13 years. I chose to be a programmer because I love problem-solving and learning new things. I also get a lot out of helping others and making their lives easier, which for me is the main purpose of technology.</p>

    <p>On the scale of geekiness where 0 is a non-geek and 10 a super geek, I'm probably a 6.5. I used to think that's a drawback but I'm getting more comfortable with it as it seems to be good for when I explain things to people who don't understand technology that much. Because the truth is there's a lot of stuff us developers don't understand either.</p>

    <p>My job is not my life. I have a lot of other important parts of my self which I try to nourish and develop. I'm a proud queer, feminist anti-capitalist, I sometimes write, I'm a sexuality explorer (sexplorer), a psychonaut, I love to dance, to meditate and a lot of other things.</p>

    <h2>Why Queer?</h2>
    <p>The term queer means different things for different people, so it's best to explain what it means for me.</p>

    <p>For me being queer is much more than a sexual identity. It means being curious about life, questioning everything we've been taught to be true, given and "normal" (I hate that word). It also means recognising that the way things are right now suit some people, but often at the expense of many others. It's about revealing power imbalances in regards to gender identity, sexuality, race, body-ability and exploring how these imbalances affect us. It's about helping and supporting each other against our real enemies, capitalism and the patriarchy.</p>

    <p>I advertise as a queer developer because I'd like to work with people who share my values, or at least support my right to be passionate about them.</p>
